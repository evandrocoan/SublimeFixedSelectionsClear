# Fixed Selections Clear


When I click `Ctrl+A` the only way to deselect is to click on arrow keys but the screen will be
moved to the beginning or end of the document. Is there a way to deselect and remain on the same
place?

This deselect the Sublime Text selection and remain on the same place. Just open the command palette
and call the command `Fixed Selections Clear`.


### Or

Just press `Ctrl+U` for `soft_undo`.
